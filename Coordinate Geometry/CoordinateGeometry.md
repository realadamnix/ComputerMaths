# Coordinate Geometry Formulae

We need to be able to use the following formulae:

1. Distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2):

   - Formula: `d = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)`
2. Midpoint, M, between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2):

   - Formula: `M = ((x1 + x2) / 2, (y1 + y2) / 2)`
3. Slope, m, of a line containing two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2):

   - Formula: `m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)`
4. Equation of a line with slope m and point (x1, y1):

   - Formula: `y - y1 = m(x - x1)`
5. General equation of a line: `y = mx + c`

   - m represents the slope of the line
   - c represents the y-intercept (where the line cuts the y-axis)
6. Parallel lines have equal slopes.
7. Perpendicular lines intersect at right angles. The product of the slopes of perpendicular lines is -1.
8. Intersection of two lines:

   - Two lines intersect at a single point (x1, y1).
   - To find the point of intersection, we use simultaneous equations.
9. Drawing a line on the Cartesian plane (the x-y axis):

   - To draw a line, we need two points.

   - Find two points on the line by solving for x and y when one of them is 0.
10. Distance between a point (x, y) and a line with equation ax + by + c = 0:
    - Formula: `d = abs(ax + by + c) / sqrt(a^2 + b^2)`
11. Equation of a circle with center (h, k) and radius r:
    - Formula: `(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2`
12. Equation of a parabola with vertex (h, k) and focus (p, q):
    - Formula: `(x - h)^2 = 4p(y - k)`
13. Equation of an ellipse with center (h, k), major axis length 2a, and minor axis length 2b:
    - Formula: `((x - h)^2 / a^2) + ((y - k)^2 / b^2) = 1`
14. Equation of a hyperbola with center (h, k), transverse axis length 2a, and conjugate axis length 2b:
    - Formula: `((x - h)^2 / a^2) - ((y - k)^2 / b^2) = 1`
15. Equation of a straight line passing through two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2):
    - Formula: `(y - y1) = ((y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1))(x - x1)`
